Notice that the right STL here is enormous - it's the result of a ton of mucking about in Meshmixer, which deforms the polygons generated during the render process in OpenSCAD. There isn't any fidelity gained by the complexity of the model, but I didn't see much value in trying to reduce the complexity before printing.
